<p>“Ride as much or as little, as long or as short as you feel. But ride.” Cycling is one of the most accessible sports on the planet, but it can also be one of the most brutal, from amateurs testing themselves to the limit in a sportive to professionals competing in the toughest races in the world. 
“Don’t buy upgrades, ride up grades.”</p>

<p>“You don’t stop riding when you get old, you get old when you stop riding.” Riding a bike in a valley or mountain with friends is one of the great feelings. Having a long drive with your bike make you feel cheerful. If you are depressed or feeling lonely, believe me, take your bike with you and go for a long drives.</p>

<p>Cars are the ultimate symbol of freedom, independence and individualism. They offer the freedom to "go anywhere," whenever it suits and with whom one chooses. Car driving is not my hobby it’s my feeling. I only love FAST CARS because I don’t believe slow and steady wins the race. Let's to short to drive boring cars.</p>
